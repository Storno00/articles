# Articles app

This is a fullstack blog application, where there are three authentication roles. As an `editor` you can write and format articles, manage each of your article's comment section, add new editor users, and edit your previous articles. As a regular `user` you can read articles, and leave comments to each published articles. As an `unauthenticated user` you can read recent articles, and browse through older ones with searching and sorting functions.
